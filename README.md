# simple-hiring-app

This is a simple hiring app created to find top candidates in a dataset. Here are some of the key functionality:

- Scroll through the different candidates and get a high-level sense for their experiences:

![main screen]('main screen.png')

- Deep-dive into a candidate's profile to learn more about their background:

![popup resume]('popup resume.png')

- Filter and rank based on role:

![filter and rank]('filtered candidates.png')

These candidates are generated by creating the top 5 candidates for the role based on candidate rank. The candidate is ranked in three ways:

1. A baseline rank accounting for various factors such as number of work experiences, highest education (biased most towards higher education), number of educational experiences (weighting more towards top 50 schools), and number of skills.

Using keywords generated by GPT:
2. A tags-based rank, comparing cosine similarity the candidates' job titles and educational subjects to pre-made keywords with an embedding model.
3. An exact match to keywords, comparing exact matches between the candidates' job titles and educational subjects to pre-made keywords with an embedding model.

The ranking is weighted most heavily towards rank 3, 2, and 1 respectively.
